# Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

## Project Overview
I used this kaggle introduction project to get more familiar with sklearn and PyTorch library. The goal is to figure out who would have survice if they were on the Titanic. 

The data set can be downloader on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data 

## My Approach
After analysing the data and preprocessing them. I decided to try different models : A simple logistic regression, a simple Neural network with just one hidden layer (so it can learn to do some feature engineering), and a Random Forest. 

All of the model had an accuracy around 80% for the validation set.

I then made my model vote for the best answer. 


## My Results on Kaggle
I submitted my predictions on Kaggle on 03/04/2024, and I received a score of 0.77511.
